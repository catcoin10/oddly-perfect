We are trying to find (odd) quasi-quasi-perfect numbers. Originally, a quasi-perfect number was defined as a number whose sum of its proper divisors is equal to that number plus six. The first such number is 8,925. These numbers are always composite (by definition) always end in five. Thus, they are always divisible by five.

A function that gives the n-th such number appears to grow very fast, but how fast is not clear.
